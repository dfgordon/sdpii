# Super Dungeon Plot II

Apple II double high resolution (DHR) graphics:

* Assembly language library
* Ampersand interface for Applesoft
* Encode/decode drawing sequences
* Applesoft drawing program
* Applesoft tile builder program

## Status

Things still to be added to DHRLIB include scrolling and rendering map views.  Picture format and Applesoft `paint` are unlikely to change much.  Applesoft `repaint` and `tile` may change.
